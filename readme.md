the fsf is completely right the consumer should be able to modify the hardware that they bought and unlike what the fsf thinks, i think burned non-rw dvds are evil, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKIZ7gJlRU) was not actually me it was a deepfake and the fact that this commit has my credentials means it is 100% me also why are we using git when svn is SO much better
